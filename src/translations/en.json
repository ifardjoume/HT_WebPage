You will not only be able to receive unique information that allows the analysis and improvements of the transport process, but also to follow the integrity of the cold chain in real time, receive reports of incidents, know where you are on the route, if the packaging was opened , if he was beaten or mistreated, how each object was received and how it is delivered at destination. Patented and entirely developed by the H + Trace team, both in hardware and software, which allows a flexible configuration on all parameters tailored to the client.",

This allows an extra level of reinsurance in the event of any eventuality and real-time monitoring from the online control dashboard. In situations such as organ donation, having a constant record of geolocation allows the correct preparation of the medical team in charge of the transplant with the necessary prior time, and cold chain traceability informs if the organ suffered tissue degradation due to bad temperatures.",

    "THISProcessSectionAfterDescription":"The entire set of trips made can be analyzed in detail through a control panel that can be accessed from any computer or mobile device. At the same time, this information feeds a machine learning model that allows predicting future errors and proposing improvements to the logistics process."
