    "THISSectionButton":"How it works",
    "THISInfoSectionDescription":"With THIS you will not only receive unique information for logistics analysis and improvement, but also monitor cold-chain integrity and package geolocation in real time, get incident alerts if the package is open, hit or mishandled, and get a report of how each item is shipped and how it is delivered at the destination. Our patented system is entirely developed −both hardware and software− by the H+Trace team, which provides flexible customization of settings and parameters tailored to the client’s needs. ",

    "THISProcessSectionOriginDescription":"With our app, the smart packaging is activated and starts recording data.",
    "THISProcessSectionDuringSubtitle":"During Transportation",
    "THISProcessSectionDuringDescription":"The packaging records all data in two ways: locally (in the internal memory of the device) and in the cloud. This provides an extra level of reassurance in the event of any unforeseen contingencies and real-time monitoring from the online dashboard. In the case of organ donations, real-time geolocation allows the medical team in charge of the transplant to prepare correctly and with the appropriate time, while cold-chain traceability registers any unexpected changes in temperature that may cause tissue damage.",
    "THISProcessSectionDestinationSubtitle":"On Arrival",
    "THISProcessSectionDestinationDescription":"Using our app, the user registers the arrival of the package and, instantly, receives a report with its information. The report includes data visualization recorded by the sensors, a detailed list of the transported items and other relevant information.",

    "THISProcessSectionAfterDescription":"All shipments can be analyzed in detail with our dashboard, which can be accessed from any computer or mobile device. This information, in turn, feeds a machine-learning model that predicts future errors and suggests improvements to the logistics process.",
